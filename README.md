# algorithms practice

Doing some algorithm practice to stay sharp since these kinds of questions are very different than my day to day as a dev. 

There's no strict pattern to these, I try to group them by algorithm type and/or the source material. The numbers in the `leetcode` folder are old leetcode IDs, they moved from numbers to strings in their problem URLs at some point. The same problem may be solved multiple times, in multiple different ways, in multiple places, in multiple different languages.

This repo is mostly for my reference. I use it to look at past solutions and to look at how I've grown. Feel free to reference and use these solutions, but I strongly recommend you solve these problems yourself :D
