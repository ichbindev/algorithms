- flag: traverse tree by level to get values or validate
- pattern: using queue, stop after each level to check size
  - since you know size, do exactly that many iterations 
  - when that's done, size of queue is size of next level
- use a queue to visit nodes in correct order
- visit root, then enqueue children
  - while queue, keep visiting and enqueueing 
  - if graph, will need to mark/keep track of visited
- uses:
  - breadth first search
  - hierarchical data processing
  - serialize/deserialize trees
  - find minimum depth of trees
  - networking and brodcasting
  - social network analysis
  - zigzag/spiral level order traversal
