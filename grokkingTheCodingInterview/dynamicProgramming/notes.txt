- algorithmic technique for solving optimization problem
  - break problem down to simpler subproblems
  - utilize fact that optimal solution for overall problem depends on optimal solution 
      to subproblems
- flag: overall solution can be broken down to solution of subproblems
- key: define recursive solution, then bottom-up with tabulation or top-down with memoization 
- characteristics:
  - overlapping subproblems: 
    - subproblem: smaller version of original problem 
    - solution involves solving same subproblem multiple times
  - optimal substructure property: overall optimal solution can be constructed from optimal 
      solution of its subproblems
  - top-down with memoization:
    - memoization: cache result of subproblem so we don't solve it repeatedly
    - top-down: solve the bigger problem by recursively finding solution to smaller sub-problems
  - bottom-up with tabulation:
    - bottum-up: solve all related sub-problems first
    - tabulation: fill in n-dimensional table, use those results to solve later problem
- solving: best way to start is to brute-force recursive solve, then apply memoization/tabulation
