- flag: input is array of range similar to array.length
- cyclic sort is an O(n^2) sorting algorithm that minimizes writes
- it is O(n) when the range is 1 - n
  - this is due to knowing that when sorted, index === array[index]
  - can be used to find missing numbers in range, since after sorting
    you can check when index !== array[index]
  - can also fudge range, but only really optimal for specific inputs
  - calc idx to place at, then see if number at that idx is equal to number at i
    - if (nums[i] !== nums[placeAtIdx]) swap else i++
- when not using range 1-n, cyclic sort uses O(n) time per element to find
  its position in the array (from idx to end, count how many elements are bigger and swap)
