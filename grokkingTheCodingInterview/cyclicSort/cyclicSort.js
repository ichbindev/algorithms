/*
We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, 
when created, was assigned a unique number from the range 
1 to n based on their creation sequence. This means that 
the object with sequence number 3 was created just before 
the object with sequence number 4.

Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their 
creation sequence number in  without using any extra space. 
For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are passed an integer array 
containing only the sequence numbers, though each number is 
actually an object.
