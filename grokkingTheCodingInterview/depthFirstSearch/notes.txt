- flag: tree or graph input, need to explore a full path or node relationship
- explore one branch of tree fully before backtracking
- three main types, the difference is when visiting/processing the node value
  - pre-order: visit the node, then the left, then the right
  - in-order: visit the left, then the node, then the right
  - post-order: visit the left, then the right, then the node
    - all above assume binary tree, visit edges/children in order if not 
- can be done recursively or with a stack to mimic recursion
- ideal for exploring entire paths or dealing with node relationships
