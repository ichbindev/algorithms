- usually slow moves once and fast moves twice
- flag: detecting a cycle or finding a node relative to cycle
- usually done on linked list or graph input, but can 
  also be used for arrays
- useful to consider where both pointers are when they meet
  - if fast 2x slow, then slow is in the middle when fast ends
  - consider using another pattern from middle or other known node
  - can do algebra to find where they meet relative to cycle
- cycle start: find meeting of fast(2x) and slow(1x), then find next meeting
  meeting with both going at slow(1x) speed
