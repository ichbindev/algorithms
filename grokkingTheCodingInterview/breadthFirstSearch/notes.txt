- flag: traverse tree by level to get values or validate
- pattern: using queue, enqueue root and while there are items in queue:
  - can check size to demarcate levels, like LOT
  - process value 
  - add children, if exist, to queue
- explore tree or graph by level, starting from root/given node
- process all nodes at one level before moving on to next, like LOT
- uses a queue, explore current level and add children to queue as you go 
- useful for understanding structure of tree or solving hierarchy problems
  - shortest path
  - level order operations
