- flag: traverse tree by level to get values or validate
- pattern: using queue, stop after each level to check size
  - since you know size, do exactly that many iterations 
  - when that's done, size of queue is size of next level
- explore tree or graph by level, starting from root/given node
- process all nodes at one level before moving on to next, like LOT
- uses a queue, explore current level and add children to queue as you go 
- useful for understanding structure of tree or solving hierarchy problems
  - shortest path
  - level order operations
