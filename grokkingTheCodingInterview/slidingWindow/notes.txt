- flag: looking for a subset or size of subset, eg range or subarray
  - especially if it's looking for a fixed size
- another flag: longest range with X replacements
- input is a string or array
- keep it simple for variable size windows: stick to for loop and 
  grow window one index at a time, then shrink when condition is met
- it may help to sort the array if order is not important
- common pattern: grow window, shrink window, check condition
- pair with map of key to counts for replacement
- pair with number for managing calculations
